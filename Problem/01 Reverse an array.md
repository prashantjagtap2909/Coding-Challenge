#### Problem 01: reverse the array

- This code defines a function reverseArray that takes an integer array arr and its length n as input and reverses the order of elements in the array. Here's how the code works

- The function initializes two variables, s and e, to the first and last index of the array, respectively. These variables represent the two endpoints of the array that will be swapped.
- The function enters a while loop that continues until s is greater than or equal to e. This loop iteratively swaps the elements at the s and e indices of the array, and then increments s and decrements e.
- The swap function is used to exchange the values of the two elements being swapped.

- After the loop finishes executing, the array is reversed and the function terminates.
